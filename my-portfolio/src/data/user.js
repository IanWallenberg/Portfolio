I am passionate about creating high-quality code that follows best practices and industry standards, and am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer. I love to create interesting user interfaces that provide functionality, simplicity but also are memorable. I'd love to showcase my projects with this portfolio, which you can find further below or in the Projects title above.

    title: "About Me:",
    description:
      "I have studied Front End Developer Program at Hyper Island in Stockholm from fall 2021 to spring 2023, and the past three monts intense Python programming. I've worked on a variety of projects during my studies and I'm proud of the progress I've made. I am a curious, adaptive and driven person who wants to gather knowledge and experience while having fun. My main interests are video games, board games, reading books, learning about Japanese culture, and more.",
    continuation:
      "When it comes to coding, I enjoy working with React a lot. It is such a fun framework to work with, and also a challenge to work with in order to understand Javascript better. Aside from that, I enjoy Vue and Vuetify, which I find is such a powerful combo when designing and coding interfaces.",
