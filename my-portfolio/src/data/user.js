      " When it comes to coding, I enjoy working with React a lot. It is such a fun framework to work with, and also a challenge to work with in order to understand Javascript better. I'd love to make contacts and get to know people studying Front End, or get to know people already in the business, or just get to know driven and passionate people who want to learn and share their experiences of life. Send a message if you're curious, or just add me on LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram or Facebook (see links below). I'm open for anything, and looking forward to new connections! I am a backend developer with expertise in Node.js. I have experience in building scalable, secure and reliable web applications using various frameworks and technologies. I enjoy solving complex problems and learning new skills. I am passionate about creating high-quality code that follows best practices and industry standards. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to grow as a developer.",

      "I have studied the Front End Developer Program at Hyper Island in Stockholm from 2021-2023. I've worked on a variety of projects during my studies and I'm proud of the progress I've made. Many of these projects are open-source and available for others to explore and contribute to. If you're interested in any of the projects I've worked on, please feel free to check out the code and suggest any improvements or enhancements you might have in mind. Collaborating with others is a great way to learn and grow, and I'm always open to new ideas and feedback.",
