# Portfolio-project

This is my portfolio! 

It is a work in progress, something I've created during my spare-time.

It's not only a showcase of all the coding projects I've done up until this point, but it's also information about me, how you can contact me and how I experiment with code working mainly with HTML and CSS. 

____________

Preparation before working on code:

sass --watch style.scss style.css
