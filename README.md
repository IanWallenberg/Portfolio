# Portfolio-project

This is my portfolio!
ðŸ’¼
It is a work in progress, something I've created during my spare-time.

It's not only a showcase of all the coding projects I've done up until this point, but it's also information about me, how you can contact me and how I experiment with code in orderr to make this portfolio. I will add on as time go by with new features and change of layout as it is a good ground to practice on.
