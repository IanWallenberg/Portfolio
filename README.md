# Portfolio
Portfolio - Collection of projects, background information, and contact information :) 

Live, up and running at www.ianwallenberg.com

This is my new portfolio in React, created in spring 2023
ðŸ’¼
It's been a work in progress, something I've created during my spare-time and after my studies at Hyper Island.

It's not only a showcase of all the coding projects I've done up until this point, but it's also information about me, how you can contact me and how I experiment with code in order to make this portfolio. 
I will add on as time go by with new features and change of layout as it is a good ground to practice on.

Enjoy!
